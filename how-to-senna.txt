Senna Commands (Windows)
	- Run From File
		Basic Command: $ senna-win32 < someFileThatHasInput.txt > someFileThatWillStoreOutput.txt
		Custom Command: $ senna-win32 OPTIONS <someFileThatHasInput.txt > someFileThatWillStoreOutput.txt
				OPTIONS can be 
				-h
				Display an inline help.
				-verbose
				Display model informations (on the standard error output, so it does not mess up the tag outputs).
				-notokentags	
				Do not output tokens (first output column).
				-offsettags
				Output start/end character offset (in the sentence), for each token.
				-iobtags
				Output IOB tags instead of IOBES.
				-brackettags
				Output 'bracket' tags instead of IOBES.
				-path <path>
				Specify the path to the SENNA data/ and hash/ directories, if you do not run SENNA in its original directory. The path must end by "/".
				-usrtokens
				Use user's tokens (space separated) instead of SENNA tokenizer.
				-posvbs
				Use verbs outputed by the POS tagger instead of SRL style verbs for SRL task. You might want to use this, as the SRL training task ignore some verbs (many "be" and "have") which might be not what you want.
				-usrvbs <file>
				Use user's verbs (given in <file>) instead of SENNA verbs for SRL task. The file must contain one line per token, with an empty line between each sentence. A line which is not a "-" corresponds to a verb.
				-pos
				-chk
				-ner
				-srl
				-psg
				Instead of outputing tags for all tasks, SENNA will output tags for the specified (one or more) tasks.
			example: $ senna-win32 -posvbs < input.txt > output.txt
